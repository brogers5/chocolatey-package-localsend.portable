VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The packaged Windows archive is available for independent download via the Releases page on
LocalSend's GitHub repository. A download link for the packaged version is included at the
following URL:
https://github.com/localsend/localsend/releases/tag/v1.12.0

For convenience, this is a direct URL to the relevant asset:
https://github.com/localsend/localsend/releases/download/v1.12.0/LocalSend-1.12.0-windows-x86-64.zip

The following PowerShell command will print a calculated SHA256 hash:

    (Get-FileHash -Path LocalSend-1.12.0-windows-x86-64.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash

This command should be executed against an independently downloaded archive, as well as the copy
distributed with the package. Both hash values should be identical. A matching hash value should
confirm that no corruption or tampering has occurred during this package's generation process.

For reference, the following SHA256 hash was calculated during the package's automated creation:
